                <p>Business Development Manager - Binance</p>
                <p>I currently lead the University Outreach Program in North America for Binance Academy. I manage all partnerships with Universities, and Student Organizations. I also manage and plan all community events on university campuses. At these University events I educate students on topics such as Crypto 101, Blockchain 101, Defi 101, Web3, and NFTs. All content posted on the Binance Academy Twitter page in North America was managed and coordinated by myself with the Social Media team. </p></td>
